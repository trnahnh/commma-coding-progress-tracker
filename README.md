# commma

> Every commit is a step.

commma turns your editor into a logbook — pace, splits, streaks, podiums — all the rituals of a real sport, for the work you already do. A VSCode extension captures your editor activity; an API ingests and aggregates it; a web app surfaces sessions, streaks, leaderboards, and shareable keyboard heatmap cards.

commma is open-source under MIT. All product concepts and social mechanics are original to this project.

## What It Does

- **Session tracking** — every continuous stretch of coding is a session with duration, pace (chars/min), lines moved, and language breakdown
- **Keyboard heatmap** — per-session visualization of which physical keys you pressed most, exported as a transparent PNG for sharing (9:16 story, 1:1 square, 16:9 banner)
- **Streaks** — daily coding streak tracked automatically
- **Leaderboards** — weekly, monthly, and all-time boards filterable by language
- **Public profiles** — shareable profile at `commma.dev/@handle` with style badges (Vim athlete, Mouse-free, etc.)
- **Activity feed** — see sessions from engineers you follow

## Privacy

commma tracks **key labels** (which physical key was pressed), never key content (what was typed). File paths are optional. Three privacy modes: `full`, `summary`, `off`. The extension code is open-source and auditable.

---

## Status

Scaffolding. The web app is a marketing landing page with mocked data; the API is a Hono hello-world; the extension ships a single stub command. Real ingest, auth, and persistence are not wired yet.

Phase 1 (foundation) is in progress.
