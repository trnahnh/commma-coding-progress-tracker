# Changelog

All notable, cross-cutting changes to commma are recorded here. Per-package
versions live in each `package.json`; this file tracks product-level changes and
any change that touches a privacy guarantee (ADR-006 requires a CHANGELOG entry).

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Web** — GitHub OAuth sign-in flow: `GET /v1/auth/github/callback` now
  redirects to `${WEB_ORIGIN}/auth/callback?code=…` (reuses the CLI one-time
  code mechanism); web `/auth/callback` route exchanges the code via `POST
  /v1/auth/cli/exchange`. `AuthProvider` context stores the refresh token in
  `localStorage` and the access token in memory; auto-refresh fires 60 s before
  JWT expiry. Nav shows avatar + sign-out when authenticated; `/signin` page
  is the entry point.
- **Web** — `/signin` page: centered full-screen layout with "Sign in with
  GitHub" button and privacy note.
- **Web** — PNG export presets on the keyboard heatmap: three buttons (1:1
  1080×1080, 9:16 1080×1920, 16:9 1920×1080) — offscreen canvas letterboxes
  the keyboard into the target dimensions with 8% margin, transparent
  background.
- **Web** — Profile page `/@handle`: avatar, 4-stat grid (sessions / time /
  streak / top lang), keyset-paginated session feed with "Load more".
- **Web** — Leaderboard page `/leaderboard`: period tabs (week/month/alltime),
  ranked rows, linked to `/@handle`.
- **Web** — Feed page `/feed`: auth-gated; session cards with user attribution
  and pagination; unauthenticated state links to `/signin`.
- **Web** — OG meta tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`,
  `twitter:card`) injected dynamically on session-detail and profile pages.
- **Web** — Landing page leaderboard section wired to live
  `GET /v1/leaderboard?period=week`; self-highlight for signed-in user.
- **Infra** — `vercel.json` SPA rewrite so all react-router paths resolve to
  `index.html` on Vercel.
- **Infra** — `apps/web/.env.example` documenting `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- **API** — Auth rate limit raised to 100/hr outside `NODE_ENV=production`
  (was 20/hr in all environments).
- **Tooling** — Vitest test runner (root `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:watch`).
  Unit tests for the pure aggregator functions (`splitIntoSessions`,
  `buildSession`, `applyActiveDate`/`streakBreakCutoff`) and the extension
  key counter (`tallyChange`, `addKeyFreq`). API build now uses
  `tsconfig.build.json` so `test/` is typechecked but excluded from `dist/`.
- **API** — expired `refresh_tokens` cleanup: an in-process daily interval
  (gated by `RUN_AGGREGATION`, started in `index.ts`) that deletes rows whose
  `expires_at` has passed, so rotated/abandoned tokens no longer accumulate.
- **API** — input-validation hardening: a 1 MB body limit on `/v1/*`
  (`413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`); the heartbeat contract now bounds `lang`/`file`/
  `project` lengths and `keystrokes`/`lines`/`ts` ranges; the `:handle` path
  param is validated before any DB lookup.
- **API** — `POST /v1/sessions/:id/heatmap-card`: server-side keyboard-heatmap
  PNG via `sharp` (SVG built from `QWERTY_LAYOUT` + the cold→`accent` ramp,
  optional `@handle`/stats overlays). Auth-required, privacy-gated (non-`full`
  owners are owner-only); `aspect` 9:16/1:1/16:9; only the `qwerty` layout for
  now. Rate-limited on its own `card` bucket (120/hr/user); the `⌘` cap renders
  as `Cmd` so the card doesn't depend on a glyph missing from common Linux
  fonts. Unblocks feed heatmap thumbnails.

### Privacy

- **API** — `privacy = summary` is now enforced server-side, not just by the
  extension. Ingest drops `file` and `key_freq` before storing for `summary`
  users and stores nothing for `off` users; `GET /v1/sessions/:id` additionally
  suppresses `files` and `keyboard_heatmap` to non-owners for `summary` owners
  (covers data captured before a switch to `summary`). Upholds ADR-006.



- **API** — streak-reset cron: an in-process hourly interval (ADR-010 style,
  gated by `RUN_AGGREGATION`, started in `index.ts`) that zeroes `current_days`
  for users whose `last_active_date` is older than yesterday (UTC), preserving
  `longest_days` and `last_active_date`. The aggregator only *bumps* streaks on
  activity and resets lazily on the next session, so without this a broken streak
  read as stale (e.g. `/v1/me`, profiles) until the user coded again. Pure cutoff
  helper `streakBreakCutoff` in `aggregate/streak.ts`; bulk `UPDATE … RETURNING`
  in `aggregate/streakReset.ts`. Skips users with un-aggregated `events`
  (`NOT EXISTS`) so a session ending near 00:00 UTC isn't mis-scored as broken
  while aggregation is still catching up.
- **API** — social endpoints: `GET /v1/users/:handle` (public profile —
  handle/avatar/streak plus aggregated `total_sessions`/`total_duration_s`/
  all-time `top_lang`; `badges` is `[]` until the Phase 4 badge system),
  `GET /v1/users/:handle/sessions` (public, keyset-paginated session list),
  `POST`/`DELETE /v1/users/:handle/follow` (auth, idempotent `204`; self-follow
  is `400`, following a `privacy='off'` user is `404`), and `GET /v1/feed`
  (auth; sessions from followed users, newest-first, keyset-paginated, excludes
  followees now set to `privacy='off'`). Profile and session-list reads are
  privacy-gated like `GET /v1/sessions/:id` (an `off` user is `404` to
  non-owners). Shared keyset-cursor and session-summary helpers
  (`lib/cursor.ts`, `lib/sessionSummary.ts`) now back `GET /v1/sessions`, the
  user session list, and the feed.
- **API** — `GET /v1/leaderboard` (public, no auth): top 100 users by coding
  time for `period` = `week` (default) / `month` / `alltime`, read from the Redis
  sorted sets and hydrated from PostgreSQL (handle, avatar, current streak, top
  language for the period). Implements the ADR-007/ADR-010 cold-start rebuild — if
  the period's sorted set is missing (Redis wiped), it is rebuilt by summing
  `sessions.duration_s` over the period window (never `events`, which are pruned).
  Users with `privacy = 'off'` are excluded. Not yet implemented: the `lang`
  filter (needs per-language sorted sets) and the `delta` rank-change field (needs
  period snapshots).
- **Extension (`@commma/extension`) 0.1.0** — real `commma: Sign in` /
  `commma: Sign out`, GitHub OAuth via a loopback redirect + one-time code
  (ADR-011), tokens stored in VSCode SecretStorage with transparent refresh, an
  activity tracker (keystrokes, lines, language, file, key-label frequency), a 60s
  heartbeat flush to `POST /v1/ingest` with simple in-memory retry, privacy modes
  (`full` / `summary` / `off`), a `commma: Pause / Resume tracking` toggle, and a
  status-bar connection indicator (click to pause/resume). The extension now
  bundles with esbuild.
- **API** — `POST /v1/auth/cli/exchange` (one-time-code → tokens); `GET
  /v1/auth/github` accepts a loopback `redirect_uri`; `POST /v1/auth/refresh` and
  `POST /v1/auth/signout` accept a `{ refresh_token }` body in addition to the
  cookie. No database migration (OAuth state and one-time codes are Redis-only).

### Fixed

- **Aggregator** — session `duration_s` is floored to `span + one heartbeat
  window` (~60s) so sub-minute sessions are no longer 0 seconds; they now earn
  leaderboard credit and produce non-zero language splits.

### Changed

- **Heatmap completeness (`@commma/shared` `KEY_LABELS`).** Added `Space` and the
  eleven punctuation physical keys (`` ` `` `-` `=` `[` `]` `\` `;` `'` `,` `.`
  `/`). The extension now maps the space character to `Space` and every shifted
  symbol to its physical key (`!`→`1`, `:`→`;`, `?`→`/`, …) instead of collapsing
  them into `Other`, so the most-pressed key (Space) and the full board now render
  on the heatmap. Still an order-destroyed histogram of physical-key identity —
  ADR-006 is unchanged (a physical-key map is not content).
- **Privacy — ADR-006 amended.** The key-label heatmap is built by reading
  `contentChanges.text` **solely to increment a frequency counter, then discarding
  the string** — never stored, logged, or transmitted; only the final
  `Record<string, number>` histogram is retained. Content is unrecoverable from
  a frequency histogram. The no-keylogging guarantee is unchanged: an order-destroyed
  histogram is key labels; a reconstructable sequence remains forbidden. Extension
  version bumped `0.0.1 → 0.1.0` to mark the amendment.
